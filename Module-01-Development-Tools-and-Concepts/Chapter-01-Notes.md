# Week 01, Chapter 01: Course Introduction & WSL Setup

## 📖 Notes

### The TDS Ecosystem & Course Philosophy

This session introduces how **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** is different from regular diploma courses.

Instead of using static content on the Seek portal, TDS is hosted on a custom external site (like `tds.iitm.ac.in`). The reason is simple: the tools used in data science evolve extremely fast, so the course updates almost **20% of its material every term** to stay industry-relevant.

A major theme of the course is **System-Level Thinking**.

The instructors highlight that even though tools like ChatGPT can generate code, real value comes from understanding how to connect systems together, especially through:

- APIs  
- Deployment  

These are described as the two most important job-ready skills, and also the areas where students struggle the most.

The course environment is designed to reflect the real world:

- Open Book  
- Open Internet  
- Open AI  

The focus is not memorizing syntax, but learning how to build solutions using available resources.

### Hands-on Lab: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

The second half of the session focuses on setting up Linux tools on Windows.

The instructors strongly recommend **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** over VirtualBox.

Why WSL?

- Runs Linux directly alongside Windows  
- Less lag and overhead than a traditional VM  
- Uses Type-1 Hypervisor integration for better performance  

A key best practice shared:

- Never use spaces in Linux filenames or usernames, as it complicates command-line operations.
