### Key Learnings
1. System Over Syntax: The course prioritizes "System-Level Thinking" (connecting APIs, databases, and deployment) over just writing Python syntax.

2. The "Save" Trap: In the custom portal, the "Check" button only validates the answer. You must click the Save button to submit the grade to the server.

3. WSL Architecture: WSL allows you to run Linux binaries natively on Windows. It is more efficient than VirtualBox because it shares the kernel/hardware resources more directly (Type-1 Hypervisor integration).

4. Deployment is Key: The two biggest hurdles for students are typically APIs (how systems talk) and Deployment (making code accessible to the world).

5. Linux Naming Convention: Always avoid spaces in file names and directory names in Linux to prevent scripting errors later.
